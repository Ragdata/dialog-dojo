--fselect filepath height width

The fselect (file-selection) dialog displays a text-entry window
in which you can type a filename (or directory), and above  that
two windows with directory names and filenames.

Here  filepath  can  be  a  filepath  in which case the file and
directory windows will display the contents of the path and  the
text-entry window will contain the preselected filename.

Use  tab  or arrow keys to move between the windows.  Within the
directory or filename windows, use the  up/down  arrow  keys  to
scroll  the  current  selection.   Use the space-bar to copy the
current selection into the text-entry window.

Typing any printable characters switches focus to the text-entry
window,  entering  that  character  as  well  as  scrolling  the
directory and filename windows to the closest match.

Typing the space character forces dialog to complete the current
name  (up  to  the point where there may be a match against more
than one entry).

Use a carriage return or the 'OK' button to accept  the  current
value in the text-entry window and exit.

On  exit,  the  contents of the text-entry window are written to
dialog's output.
