--textbox file height width

A  text  box  lets  you display the contents of a text file in a
dialog box.  It is like a simple text file viewer.  The user can
move  through  the  file by using the cursor, page-up, page-down
and HOME/END keys available on most keyboards.  If the lines are
too  long to be displayed in the box, the LEFT/RIGHT keys can be
used to scroll the text region horizontally.  You may  also  use
vi-style  keys h, j, k, and l in place of the cursor keys, and B
or N in place of the page-up and page-down keys.  Scroll up/down
using  vi-style  'k'  and 'j', or arrow-keys.  Scroll left/right
using vi-style 'h' and 'l', or arrow-keys.   A  '0'  resets  the
left/right  scrolling.   For  more convenience, vi-style forward
and backward searching functions are also provided.

On exit, no text is written to dialog's output.  Only an  'EXIT'
button  is  provided  for  input,  but an ESC exit status may be
returned.
